# React Weather App

### About This Project:
This is the first React project that I have built. It is a simple app that displays weather information for a user input location. I mainly followed a Youtube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuA0_Z1llYU) to complete this project. However, I plan to continue making improvements so that I can gain more experience with React and make the app more my own.

Additions I have made:
* Separating the project into two components instead of one
* Simplifying the styling

Some Additions I plan to make:
* Properly handling user input errors
* Making the UI more interesting (ex. adding rain, sun, etc. icons depending on weather descriptor)
* Improving responsiveness of UI

### How To Use App:
Simply visit the URL (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!), input a location into the search bar, and hit "Enter".

### Implementation:
As stated above, I used React JS to build this app. To get the displayed weather information, I used a free weather api from https://openweathermap.org/api.

### Challenges & Solutions:
Since this was my first React project, there was a small learning curve, but no major issues arose. I did have some confusion when trying to separate the components- just required a little bit of extra research, though!

This app is far from perfect, but I think it is a great start to my experience with React!!
